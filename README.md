# QRCode Generator
QR code generator 
In this example, we create a QR code instance and add the data "Hello, World!" to it. Then we generate the QR code and create an image from it using the make_image() method. Finally, we save the image to a file named "qrcode.png".

Note that you may need to install the qrcode library using pip before running this code.

# How to use:
Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: python.org/downloads/

Download the run.py file to your local computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the run.py file.

Run the run.py file by typing the following command in the terminal:python run.py
This will execute the code in the run.py file.

To post the run.py file on GitHub, you need to create a new repository. Go to github.com and click on the "New" button on the homepage or navigate to github.com/new. Give your repository a name and make sure to select "Public" or "Private" based on your preference.

Once you've created your repository, click on the "Upload files" button and select the run.py file from your local computer.

Add a commit message describing the changes you've made (e.g. "Add run.py file").

Click on the "Commit changes" button to upload the file to GitHub.

That's it! Your run.py file is now posted on GitHub and can be accessed by anyone with access to your repository. To run the code, others will need to download the run.py file and follow the same steps to execute it on their local computer.
