QR code generator 
In this example, we create a QR code instance and add the data "Hello, World!" to it. Then we generate the QR code and create an image from it using the make_image() method. Finally, we save the image to a file named "qrcode.png".

Note that you may need to install the qrcode library using pip before running this code.
